//! Module which contains utility functions used to update maps leaderboards and get players ranks.
//!
//! When retrieving the rank of a player on a map, or updating its leaderboard, this module uses
//! a lock system.
//!
//! The Obstacle API uses the standard competition ranking system (1224) to order the leaderboards
//! of the maps. However, the server we use to store the maps leaderboards, Redis, doesn't support
//! the standard competition ranking system, but only the ordinal ranking (1234).
//!
//! Giving a map and a player we want to get the rank of, the alternative is to retrieve the rank
//! of the first player that has the same time. This requires executing many commands to
//! the Redis server:
//!
//! 1. `ZRANGEBYSCORE` to get the sorted list of the players having the same time
//! 2. `ZRANK` to get the rank of the first player of this list
//!
//! However, because Redis doesn't support transactional mode[^note], there are cases where
//! the leaderboard of a map is being both read and updated at the same time by many different API
//! operations. For example, when a player finishes a map, the leaderboard is updated ; at the same
//! time, another request may be reading the same leaderboard.
//!
//! Imagine a request A that needs to get the rank of a player on a map, and a request B that updates
//! the same leaderboard. Both requests run at the same time, so the time of the player in Redis on
//! this map can be updated *after* the request A started, but *before* the latter retrieves
//! his rank. Thus, the request A will retrieve the rank of a time that isn't in the Redis
//! leaderboard, because it has been previously updated to a newer time.
//!
//! The solution of replacing the player's time in the leaderboard by the time we're getting
//! the rank of, doesn't work. The leaderboard might be updated once again right after by
//! the request B[^note2].
//!
//! The only solution is to make a leaderboard lock system. If you need to read the leaderboard of
//! a map, you have to lock it, to avoid stale read issues ; and To lock a leaderboard, you need
//! to wait for any other pending lock.
//!
//! You may think that these are very rare cases, but they actually happen quite often. Especially
//! with the staggered requests system, and finish requests that can be numerous if the player
//! had a lot of cached requests. This causes a lot of updates of the same map leaderboard.
//! Many finish requests can also be sent during a cup, for example LoL cups, Choco cups, Campaigns,
//! etc.
//!
//! Any operation on a map's leaderboard must be done using functions defined in the [`ranks`](super)
//! module. This minimizes inconsistency issues by locking the leaderboards for each operation.
//!
//! However, we might still do reads/updates to the leaderboards without passing by this module, and
//! these can be done when a leaderboard is actually locked. We consider this case very rare.
//! Otherwise, to fix it, we would have to emulate the isolation part of a transactional mode in
//! any DBMS, so that all the operations on a leaderboard to get the rank of a player are made
//! on the same version of it ; and to emulate this, we have to clone the leaderboard
//! for each request, which is very cumbersome and slow. Thus, we ignore this issue.
//!
//! [^note]: Redis actually supports transactional mode, but the way it works is by queuing the
//! commands ; so we can't use it because we want to use the result of the previous commands before
//! running the next ones.
//! [^note2]: We update the player's time in the leaderboard anyway if the one we're getting the
//! rank of is lower than the one stored in the leaderboard, to keep the Redis leaderboard updated,
//! and minimize inconsistencies between Redis and MariaDB.
